### üî© Dependencies

- Deprecated `boto` is replaced with `boto3` (used to handle AWS S3
  downloads). Fixes [#5597](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/5597)
  via [PR #7340](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/7340)
  (by [@mslw](https://github.com/mslw), [@effigies](https://github.com/effigies), and [@yarikoptic](https://github.com/yarikoptic)). 
  Remaining issues:
  - no download progress indication,
  - no "Range" support (for partial downloads),
  - `host` option is no longer supported.

### üè† Internal

- Retry logic for S3 connections is now handed over to Boto3 and its
  standard mode, removing our custom method.
